Introduction
============

Aim

This document describes the current working plan for DRP development, 
covering the period from October 2018 until the end of operations.

Notes
-----

Each 2D-DRP release is named according to an incremental version number of the form <major>.<minor> . 
For historical reasons, the initial version described in this plan is 4.0 .


2DDRP-4.0 (Sep 2018)
====================

This is the initial release of the pipeline. Used for SM1 r-channel testing at LAM.

- Basic functionality
- Low-level test harness.

2DDRP-5.0 (Apr 2019)
====================

Initial end-to-end demonstration of pipeline. Integration test incorporates the 2D simulator,
that provides test quartz, arcs and science data. 

- all 3 arms (R, B and NIR) processed 
- 3 arms merged
- initial flat-fielding in accordance to new framework
- detector map generated
- initial flux calibration?

2DDRP-6.0 (Sep 2019)
====================

Release version for early commissioning.
